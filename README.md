# E-commerce Backend Docker Setup

This guide provides instructions to set up the necessary services for the e-commerce backend using Docker.

## PostgreSQL Database Setup

The backend relies on a PostgreSQL database. Use one of the following commands to run the database container:

### Option 1: Basic Setup (No Backup)
This will start the database without enabling backup functionality.

```bash
docker run --name sklepdb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
```

### Option 2: Backup Enabled
This option sets up the database with a backup directory mapped to your local machine. Replace `D:\Dev\ecommerce-be\postgres_backup` with the desired directory on your computer.

```bash
docker run --name sklepdb -p 5432:5432 -v D:\Dev\ecommerce-be\postgres_backup:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
```

## FTP Server Setup

To configure an FTP server for file management, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name ftp -p 8001:21 -p 21000-21010:21000-21010 -e USERS="sklep|12345678|/home/sklep|10000" delfer/alpine-ftp-server
```
